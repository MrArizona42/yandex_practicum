## Yandex Practicum Projects

Here are some of the projects from my study in Yandex Practicum.

**EDA projects**
- [Video Games EDA](https://github.com/MrArizona42/yandex_practicum/tree/main/eda_games_project)  
This was mostly a descriptive statistical project. The goal was to explore the data of video games sales in different regions and try to find some insights that would help plan the sales in the following year.
- [Real Estate EDA](https://github.com/MrArizona42/yandex_practicum/tree/main/eda_real_estate_project)  
Another EDA project. The goal was to explore the data of real estate sales advertisements and find out what factors influence the houses' prices the most.

**Classical ML projects**
- [Client churn prediction in telecom - classification project](https://github.com/MrArizona42/yandex_practicum/tree/main/ml_final_telecom_project)  
The goal of the project was - to build a model that would predict client's leave using some history data.
- [Oil production revenue - regression project (coming soon)](https://github.com/MrArizona42/yandex_practicum/tree/main/ml_oil_production_revenue)  
The goal of this project was to investigate the data of geological exploration in several regions and build a model that would predict the amount of oil that can be produced in the region. This information can help choose the most productive region.
- [Gold mining - regression project (coming soon)]()  
The goal of this project was to predict the recovery rate in gold mining process. This information can help optimize the production line and elimimnate possible losses.

**Deep Learning projects**
- [Semantic analysis - NLP](https://github.com/MrArizona42/yandex_practicum/tree/main/ml_bert_project)  
The goal of this project was to study the basic concepts of working with text data. Classical method of feature-extraction like TF-IDF was compared to the Neural Network application to obtain text embeddings.
